# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-27

### ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Removed legacy config parameters**: Character-based limits (`max_chars_per_line`, `translation_max_chars_per_line`, etc.) replaced by display width parameters (`max_display_width`, `translation_max_display_width`, etc.). `timing_trim_seconds` removed in favor of automatic pause detection.
- **API changes**: `adjust_timing()` method replaced by `apply_offset()`. `refine()` now requires `min_duration` parameter (default: 1.2s).
- **Word-level timestamps enabled by default**: All Whisper backends now extract word-level timestamps for precise timing.
- **`min_line_duration` default changed**: Increased from 0.6s to 1.2s to meet professional subtitle standards and eliminate "flash" subtitles.

### Added

- **Word-level timing & intelligent splitting**: Subtitles split at natural pauses, silence segments removed automatically, and lines respect semantic boundaries for professional quality
  - `pause_threshold_seconds` (0.3s), `silence_threshold_seconds` (2.0s), `remove_silence_segments` (true), `prefer_sentence_boundaries` (true)
- **Display width control**: Industry-standard single-line display guarantee with CJK character awareness (2Ã— width)
  - Source: `max_display_width` (42.0), `min_display_width` (20.0)
  - Translation: `translation_max_display_width` (30.0), `translation_min_display_width` (15.0)
- **CJK punctuation simplification**: Optional replacement of commas/periods with spaces (`simplify_cjk_punctuation`, default: false)
- **Orphaned word merging**: Short lines automatically merged to previous line (up to 25% overage) for better readability

### Changed

- Simplified time offset logic, enabled word timestamps for all backends, enhanced configuration UI

### Improved

- **Duration-aware merging**: Short-duration segments now automatically merge to avoid "flash" subtitles (respecting professional standard: <1s segments â‰¤5%)
  - Merging respects long silence gaps and won't merge across intentional splits
  - Significantly reduces short subtitle flashes while maintaining readability
- **CPS (Characters Per Second) control**: New `max_cps` parameter prevents information overload
  - Default: 20.0 for mixed text (suitable for English with numbers/symbols)
  - Recommended: 12-15 for CJK-only content
  - All merge operations now respect CPS limits to ensure comfortable reading speed
- Faster splitting algorithm, accurate timing without manual tuning, better handling of varied speech patterns

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed
- Support both `mlx-whisper` and `mlx_whisper` CLI names for MLX backend detection
- Updated license format to SPDX standard, eliminating setuptools warnings
- Properly excluded test files from distribution packages

### Documentation
- Clarified that Whisper backend installation is optional when using cloud API
- Highlighted API backend option as recommended for quick start
- Removed outdated pipx inject notes (smart fallback logic makes them unnecessary)
- Added explanation of shared API key usage for OpenAI services
- Improved sample configuration with API backend examples

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-26

### Changed
- Default the working directory to `~/.cache/transub`, keeping intermediate audio, transcription segments, and translation progress out of the project tree.
- Export subtitles to the same directory as the source video unless `pipeline.output_dir` is set, reducing stray output folders.
- Refreshed English and Chinese READMEs to highlight the new defaults, add pip/pipx installation flows, and ensure links work on PyPI.

### Packaging
- Bumped the published version to `0.1.1`.
- Shipped `transub-sample.conf` from within the package so editable installs and wheels reference the same path.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-26

- Initial release.
